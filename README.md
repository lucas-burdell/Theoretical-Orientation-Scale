# Theoretical Orientation Scale Web App

!!**THIS PROJECT IS NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL**!!

### About
This is a web-based implementation of the Theoretical Orientation Scale as found [here.](https://study.sagepub.com/jonessmith2e/student-resources/theoretical-orientation-scale)

A theoretical orientation scale is a series of questions scored with a [Likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) with the purpose of determining your preferred theoretical approach to counseling. This questionnaire helps counseling students in determining approaches they agree with. This scale isn't scientifically supported and as such is potentially flawed, and should only be used for self-discovery and educational purposes.

I built this project primarily in JavaScript using the libraries [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/).
